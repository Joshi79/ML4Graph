# Machine Learning for Graphs
## Exploiting Centrality Information with Graph Convolutions for Network Representation Learning

This repository is there for the reason to replicate part of the given Research paper. 
The code is based on the GraphSage algorithm which was created by Williams. 
The code is extended to show a simple GraphCSC model for Degree centrality. 

It is important to Know to run the code in this repository, it is required to use Python 3.6.0. \
The Preprocessed data can be found in the data folder. \
The data preprocessed steps are shown in the folder preprocessing.
